<strong>Using ASM Turtle</strong>
<dd>A turtle program is a <A HREF="HelpC.html">list of commands</A> given to a turtle to carry out(execute).  These cammands can do many things from drawing a line by moving the turtle forward, turning the turtle, to jumping to any command in the program.  You can repeat commands as many times as you want by using a <A HREF="HelpLPS.html">loop</A> or jump(skip) over any commands you don't want the turtle to follow.  The turtle is smarter than the average turtle.  He is so smart, he can do trigonometry with sin and cos.  Click <A HREF="HelpC.html">here</A> for a list of commands.<br>

<strong>About ASM Turtle</strong>
<dd>The program was developed to create graphics similar to witch are created by Logo's Turtle.  If you are not familiar with it, Turtle was originally made in the late 1960's by Logo to teach people basic programming and language concepts.  The original program used a <A HREF="HelpGlossary.html#HLL">high level language</A>.  It was called "Turtle" because the programming was of a computer generated turtle that followed the program's instrustions and made a trail behind him as he walked.  This program uses a language similar to assembly(a low level language) to program very similar graphical programs.  ASM Turtle is to teach some people about some of the ways assembly is different from high level programming languages.  This includes the ways loops, if statements, and stacks are used.<br>
