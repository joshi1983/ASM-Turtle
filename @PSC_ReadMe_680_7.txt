Title: ASM Turtle 2
Description: Last updated on September 7, this program shows how to make an interpreter. The script is based on the assembly language with jumps and labels but still programs graphical output just the same as Logo's Turtle. It has 5 html help files. I hope you like it. Please comment on the program. I'd like to know what changes or additions might be good for the program.
