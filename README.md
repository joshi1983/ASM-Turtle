# ASM Turtle

ASM Turtle was inspired by the Logo programming language and its turtle graphics.  ASM Turtle lets you express turtle graphics drawing algorithms in a style similar to an assembly programming language.  Loops are implemented using jumps and labels similar to assembly.  Instead of operators, you use opcodes.

The Delphi code was written in Delphi 4 around 2000 to 2003 using Windows 98.  The code was shared on planet-source-code.com which was shut down years ago.  I'm sharing on github now to make it available to anyone interested.
