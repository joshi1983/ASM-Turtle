<strong><h1>ASM Turtle Variables</h1></strong>
<strong>Declaring Variables</strong>
<dd>Variables can be declared 2 ways.  They can be listed in the memobox labelled "Variables" or they can be declared in with the code.  
<br>
<br>
<dd><b>Variables in Memo</b>
<dd><dd>The variable declaration in the memobox is very simple.  Just put the name of the variable in the list.
<br>
<br>
<dd><b>Variables in Code</b>
<dd><dd>Declaring variables in code is a little more difficult than with the memo.  The variables declared in the code are pushed onto a variable stack.  You can use a variable identifier as you do with labels to refer to that variable on the stack.  You have to be sure to pop all of these pushed values off the stack or you could have a stack overflow error.  If you are using a procedure, you can also declare parameters.  The parameters are used to identify parameters that were pushed onto the variable stack before the calling of the procedure.<br>
